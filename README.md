****HEADPHONES WARNING****
The audio sounded fine in Unity, but in the build it is quite loud. Make sure you do a volume check before running it
**************************

I created an audio visualizer that responds to audio by speeding the particles up and by altering noise values on a sphere.
The particle paths and the sphere waves both use different types of noise to create their varied movement. You can press 1, 2, and 3 to change the songs.
